This is a basic coin flip project. Here's what I did:

1. First, I coded a standard coin flip that would display either Heads or Tails when the function was called.
2. Next, I created a new coin flip game that would require the user to call the function with the desired number of times they would like the coin to be flipped. The code will then display each outcome and the number of times each outcome was presented.
